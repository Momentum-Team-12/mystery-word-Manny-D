# MVP
1. computer read file -> working
with open('test-word.txt') as f:
    word_string = f.read()
    word_list = word_string.split()
    current_word = random.choice(word_list)


2. start with test_word.txt (one word) -> working
same as above => have to update ('test-word.txt') to ('words.txt')


3. tell user how many letters word has -> working
print(len(word)) -> thought / see below 
print("Ok.. let's play!\n" "Your word is", len(current_word), "letters long.")


4 Ask user to guess one letter -> working
guess = input("\nPlease enter 1 letter to guess: ")


5. Tell the user if the guess is in the word
same as 6


6. Display partially guessed word like in Wheel of Fortune
for char in current_word:
    if char in answer:
        print(char, end = "")
        
    elif char not in answer:
        print("*", end = "")


7. game ends when player guesses word -> wonky and likely needs to be changed
if w == 0: # works but want to try something different
            print("\nYou did it!\nThe Mystery Word was " + current_word + " and was solved in " + str(8 - count) + " guesses!")
            exit()
    



*MVP's done'ish*



# 2.0
1. design the word selection after the game logic
?

2. computer chooses random word -> done?
current_word = random.choice(word_list)

3. validate guess - make sure is only one letter
if not guess.isalpha(): # looks to be working now
    print("Invalid entry. Please enter letters only.")

4. limit user to 8 guesses, game ends if user runs out of guesses
count = 8
if count == 0:
    print("\nGame Over!!\nNo more guesses left =(\nThe Mystery Word was " + current_word + ".")
    break

5. user guesses same letter twice, do not take away a guess
if not guess.isalpha(): # looks to be working now
    print("\nInvalid entry: " + guess + ". Please enter a letter only.")
elif len(guess) > 1:   # looks to be working even if correct letter entered
    print("\nInvalid entry: " + guess + ". Only 1 letter please.")


6. print message that they can guess again
if answer not in current_word:
    count -= 1
    print("Sorry, try again!\nYou have " + str(count) + " guesses remaining)")
